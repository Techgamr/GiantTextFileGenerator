# GiantTextFileGenerator

lol

## Build Instructions
You must have Git and .NET 5 installed.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Techgamr/GiantTextFileGenerator.git
$ cd GiantTextFileGenerator
$ dotnet restore
```

Build the project how you like (I recommend building for x64 if you can)

## Usage
Run the file (either by double-clicking on the file in File Explorer on Windows,
or from the command line).
It will prompt you if you want to continue, press `C`.

Follow the prompts, and then press `Enter` to start.
It may take some time.
